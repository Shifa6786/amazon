        <p>The Madras Act XXIV of 1859 which marked the beginning of the Madras Police and shortly later, the Police Act of 1861 instituted the system of police which forms the foundation of modern-day police in India. The "Ceded Areas" of Andhra, as they were popularly known, continued as a part of the Madras Police and it was only in October 1953, after the birth of a separate Andhra State, that the Andhra State Police gained individual existence.<br> Finally with the formation of the Andhra Pradesh on 1 November 1956 integrating the Telugu areas of the erstwhile Hyderabad state with the Andhra State, the modern day Andhra Pradesh Police came into existence.<br> After the bifurcation of the state in 2014, the police force once again bifurcated.<br>This time, it was divided into Andhra Pradesh police and Telangana Police.</p>
